# Shadcn UI Components

This project utilizes @shadcn/ui for user interface components. These are beautifully designed, accessible components that can be customized to fit your application.

## Locating Installed Components

Components are available in the `src/components/ui` directory, as configured by aliases in the `components.json` file.

## Using a Component

Import a component using the configured `@/` alias:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Tabs, TabsContent, TabsList, TabsTrigger } from "@/components/ui/tabs";
import {
  Card,
  CardContent,
  CardDescription,
  CardFooter,
  CardHeader,
  CardTitle,
} from "@/components/ui/card";
```

Sample component usage:

```tsx
<Button variant="outline">Click me</Button>

<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Card Title</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>Card Description</CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <p>Card Content</p>
  </CardContent>
  <CardFooter>
    <p>Card Footer</p>
  </CardFooter>
</Card>
```

## Installing Additional Components

Many additional components are available but not installed by default. You can find the full list at https://ui.shadcn.com/r

To install a new component, use the shadcn CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
```

For example, to add the accordion component:

```bash
